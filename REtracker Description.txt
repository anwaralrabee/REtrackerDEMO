REtracker

The T265 is an Intel RealSense high precision tracking sensor. 
We used it to create our own REtracker software. The software is renderer agnostic, meaning it works with all engines. 
You donâ€™t need any markers at the set and you can use it outdoors and indoors. You need to purchase the sensor yourself from Intel website (check readme file)

The price is 2000$/studio.  Meaning you can use the same license for up to 6 cameras (u need one sensor per camera, sensor costs 199$)
We also provide one on one remote support and training. This offer is only available for select customers as we are limiting it to few licenses per region.
The sensor connects to the PC or to a laptop. You can use any broadcast camera. It is mounted on top of it.
The REtracker software can be installed on any mini pc (i3, 4 GB ram) and the software will send tracking data via Wifi. Or you can connect it directly to the renderer PC. 

When we started this project our goals were:
- initial deployment time of less than 10 minutes
- Daily use setup should take less than 2 minutes
- Robust enough for live broadcast
- Ability for use with most engines
- Very easy workflow

We uploaded an Aximmetry sample project on our github ( https://github.com/mrassi/REtrackerDEMO ) and two compounds:
1 - tracking data receiver 
2- lens distortion compound

you can track 3 cameras simultaneously with the same Aximmetry license on a single PC

As for Unreal it works with the native unreal plugins. Just check the UE project in the link.
